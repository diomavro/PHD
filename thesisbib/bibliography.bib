Following Grossman and Hart, we identify a firm with the assets that its owners control. We argue that the crucial difference for party 1 between owning a firm (integration) and contracting for a service from another party 2 who owns this firm (nonintegration) is that, under integration, party 1 can selectively fire the workers of the firm (including party 2), whereas under nonintegration he can "fire" (i.e., stop dealing with) only the entire firm: the combination of party 2, the workers, and the firm's assets. We use this idea to study how changes in ownership affect the incentives of employees as well as those of owner-managers. Our framework is broad enough to encompass more general control structures than simple ownership: for example, partnerships and worker and consumer cooperatives all emerge as speical cases.},

5) If an asset only adds value if it it is in the same coalition as a specific agent then that agent should own the asset. 
6) If an agent is indespensable to an asset then he should own it. 
7) If more than half of a group are needed to generate marginal product from an asset, they should decide democratically how to use it. 
8) If two or more assets are complementary they should be owned or controlled together. 
9) Agents who are dispensible and have no investment should not have any control rights if stochastic control is possible
10)If coalitions don't need each other for marginal product then each coalition should own its own assets.
11) If an agent needs an asset contribute, the owner of that asset accumulating more assets will strictly increase the investment of the first agent.},

@article{Hart2017,
abstract = {The work on incomplete contracts cited by the prize committee began in the sum-mer of 1983, but it may be useful to say a bit about how I reached that point. As a graduate student, first at the University of Warwick and then at Princeton University, with a degree in mathematics behind me, I was drawn to general equilibrium theory, and my PhD thesis was on general equilibrium theory with incomplete markets. 1 Although I ended up focusing on optimality and existence problems that could arise even in exchange economies, one of my primary interests was the theory of produc-tion. In a complete markets, Arrow-Debreu economy with perfect competition, it makes sense for a firm to maximize profit or net market value. But with incomplete markets, what is the generalization of this goal? More fundamentally, what happens if shareholders disagree about what the firm should do? 2},

abstract = {We consider an incomplete contracting model of bilateral trade in intellectual property ( IP) with sequential investments in its quality and with financial constraints. A financially-constrained inventor invests in an idea which she then sells to a buyer. The buyer in turn invests in developing this idea into a marketable product. We propose a novel formulation of ex ante control rights of an IP buyer, over the financially-constrained IP seller. We do not assume alienability of the inventor's ideas; the control right is defined as ex ante prescribed prohibition of ex interim financial contracting with third parties. We show that such an agreement strengthens the seller's ex ante incentives to invest in the quality of her product which is to be traded at the interim stage. The enforcement of this control right is credible, or renegotiation-proof, only for the controlling buyer (a downstream user of the IP), and not for other potential partners of the seller, such as independent venture capitalists. We thereby obtain a rationale for a key role of Corporate Venturing in promoting innovative activities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We consider a holdup problem in which two parties make relationship-specific investments sequentially to generate a joint surplus in the future. In our model, the following ownership structure implements first-best investments: one party owns the firm initially, while the other party has the option to buy the firm at a set price at a later date. This result is robust to the possibility of renegotiation and uncertainty.},

General Results:
1) No unconditional ownership rights induces first best investments
2) Option giving the second investor the right to buy the asset at the price which equals the value of the utility with both users at first best invesment conditional on the second investor ownership gives first best.
3) If there is renegotiation the contract also gives first best after investments have been made. 
4) With renegotiation, first investor ownership induces first best only if he has all the bargaining power in the renegotiation OR If A was going to choose her efficient investment level without renegotiation anyway
5) If a can't invest above a certain ceiling which is below the optimal then there is no option contract that can fix this. If on the other hand he can invest more than first best then that contract can help them.

@article{Weeds2002,
abstract = {This paper considers irreversible investment in competing research projects with uncertain returns under a winner-takes-all patent system. Uncertainty takes two distinct forms: the technological success of the project is probabilistic, while the economic value of the patent to be won evolves stochastically over time. According to the theory of real options uncertainty generates an option value of delay, but with two competing firms the fear of preemption would appear to undermine this approach. In non-cooperative equilibrium two patterns of investment emerge depending on parameter values. In a pre-emptive leader-follower equilibrium firms invest sequentially and option values are reduced by competition. A symmetric outcome may also occur, however, in which investment is more delayed than the single-firm counterpart. Comparing this with the optimal cooperative investment pattern, investment is found to be more delayed when firms act non-cooperatively as each holds back from investing in the fear of starting a patent race. Implications of the analysis for empirical and policy issues in R{\&}D are considered.本文研究在“赢者通吃”的专利体系下，收益不确定的竞争性研究项目的不可逆投资。不确定性采用截然不同的两种形式：项目在技术上的成功是或然的，而获胜的专利的经济价值随时间随机变化。根据实物期权理论，不确定产生等待的期权价值，但是两个竞争的企业对于对手抢先投资的恐惧似乎会削弱这种方法。在非合作均衡处，投资的两种模式哪种会出现，取决于参数的值。在抢先投资的领先者-追随者均衡中，企业序列地投资，期权价值由于竞争而减少。然而，对称的结果也可能出现，在此情形中，投资比在单个企业的情形中更迟。将此与最优合作投资模式相比，由于对于引发专利竞赛的担心阻碍了企业的投资，所以当企业非合作地行动时，投资更迟。最后讨论了本研究对于企业研发的实证和政策问题的意义。},

@article{GlenWeyl2012,
abstract = {What is the best way to reward innovation? While prizes avoid deadweight loss, intellectual property (IP) selects high social surplus projects. Optimal innovation policy thus trades off the ex ante screening benefit and the ex post distortion. It solves a multidimensional screening problem in the private information held by the innovator: research cost, quality, and market size of the innovation. The appropriate degree of market power is never full monopoly pricing and is determined by measurable market characteristics, the inequality and elasticity of innovation supply, making the analysis open to empirical calibration. The framework has applications beyond IP policy to the optimal pricing of platforms or the optimal procurement of public infrastructure. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Kultti2006,
abstract = {This article discusses inventors with simultaneous models of innovation regarding patent policies and secrecy. When some innovators resort to secrecy and some patent, it can only induce more innovators to patent without affecting their research and development expenditures. There are numerous studies suggesting that patents typically offer weaker protection than secrecy and that they stimulate information disclosure rather than investments in innovation. Traditionally the patent system has been regarded as necessary to create the incentive to innovate by awarding property rights over innovations. The article argues that a weak patent system should be devised for innovators to patent their discoveries rather than keep them secret. Such a patent system could stimulate both information dissemination and innovative activity.},

@article{Lemley2005,
abstract = {This article explores the economics of probabilistic patents. We begin with a brief description of the system by which patents are issued and litigated in the United States. We then discuss uncertainty regarding commercial significance and how patent applicants and would-be licensees hedge against that uncertainty. We turn next to proposals to reform the system by strengthening the examination process through which patents are granted. This literature emphasizes that expending the resources necessary to increase the certainty of issued patents across-the- board may not make economic sense given the vast number of patent applications and the small number that end up being commercially important. More effective are patent reforms that focus resources on patent applications that are likely to be of commercial significance. We then explore the incentives of patent holders and alleged infringers to settle their disputes rather than litigate them to completion. Indeed, virtually every patent licensing and cross-licensing agreement can be seen as the settlement of a patent dispute. However, the frequency or form of such private settlements may not serve the public interest, because litigating patent disputes to completion tends to generate positive externalities, by clarifying the limits of patent protection if the patent is upheld or encouraging wider use of the innovation if the patent is invalidated. While settlements of patent litigation between actual or potential rivals are normal and generally desirable, they also are agreements between competitors that can limit competition. In fact, a recent flurry of court cases have recognized the impact of uncertainty while scrutinizing the antitrust implications of patent settlements.},

Building on Hart-Moore (1999), we provide conditions under which an optimal contract consists of nothing more than an assignment of property rights. We also examine the robustness of some of the literature's standard predictions about asset ownership to the introduction of mechanisms for eliciting parties' ex post willingness to pay for the assets (such as options or financial markets). To illustrate the issue, we revisit the Hart-Moore (1990) proposition that joint ownership is suboptimal, and argue that ownership by a single party is dominated by joint ownership with put options.},
