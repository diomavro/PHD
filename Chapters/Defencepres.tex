\begin{itemize}
    \item What is an innovation? New market or increase surplus in existing market
%    \item There is some project that will be undertaken if its costs exceed its benefits. There are many reasons why this would not occur, the language of economics likes to frame these frictions as transaction costs. 
% \item Innovation would present no problem if contracting was possible everywhere. 
    \item The problem of ex-ante contractability. (Incomplete Contracts, Grossman and Hart(1986))
%If firms cannot contract before an innovation exists, there exists a problem of 
    \item Solution: Intellectual property, endogenize research, etc
% \item if the innovation isn't ex-ante profitable, why would we want to pursue it? 
% \item The problem is the disconnect between profits and welfare, maybe an innovation will be worthwhile from the point of view of welfare but not from the point of view of profits. 
% \item the problem of fixed research/development costs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Motivation: Piracy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The intellectual property claim: limiting entry $\rightarrow$ increases the incentive to innovate.
    \item The piracy claim: making piracy illegal $\rightarrow$ increases the incentive to innovate.
    \item The monopoly issue: If a single firm sells the asset and has control of the price $\rightarrow$ the price set will be above what is welfare maximizing. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1) Does uniform enforcement of intellectual property increase innovation?
    \item 2) Does social value enchance or curtail monopoly power?
    \item 3) Who benefits from piracy? 
    \item 4) Is the incentive to improve the product independent of social value? 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Model components:}
\begin{itemize}
%Legal Assymetry 
%     \item When a firm violates a copyright it is an infringment (tort) 
%     \item When a consumer violates a copyright it is theft (criminal)
% % The cost of pirating is set exogenously whilst the cost of infringement is set endogenously
% % Is there a time where a firm does not wish to enforce it's right? 
%     \item Digital goods have only fixed costs, marginal costs are zero
    \item The main modelling component used is social value.
    \item Agents have the option of buying, pirating and not using.
    \item Using encompasses pirating or buying. 
    \item Easier to pirate 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  $\rightarrow$ More pirates some of which used to buy but also higher willingness to pay of buyers. 
            \item  $\rightarrow$ Buyers have a higher willingness to pay.

    \item Does social value enhance or curtail monopoly power? \textcolor{red}{curtail}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Buyouts claim: Having the option of being bought out can only increase innovation. 
    \item Industry consolidation: Is it efficienct?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1) Does the alienability of assets have a uniform effect (is the order the same)?
    \item $B<A<0 \rightarrow 0<B<A $
    \item $B<A<0 \rightarrow 0<A<B $  
% So suppose two projects have a value of 100 without buyouts, do both projects have a value of 150 with buyouts?  
    \item 2) Do existing firms always have an incentive to promote buyouts?
    \item 3) Why does successful innovation often lead to buyouts?
% Why do so many entrepreneurs end up being bought over?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do existing firms always have an incentive to promote buyouts? \textcolor{red}{No}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Tentative answer 3}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why does successful innovation often lead to buyouts?\textcolor{red}{ Because innovators purposefully choose projects with the intent of being bought out.}

\begin{frame}{Discounting: motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phenomenon:} Agents prefer present payments to future payments. 
    \item \textbf{Definition:} A discount rate is the rate you must multiply the future payment to get the value of an equivalent payment in the present.
    \item Experimentally, people discount payment hyperbolically, yet there is variance.
    \item Firm criteria for investing is mostly based on exponential discounting (NPV).
    \item Theory points to exponential discounting as profit maximizing.
