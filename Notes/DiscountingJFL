He says that we need to be careful about our language, sometimes preference reversal and dynamic inconsisteny is the same thing. 

We don't have to speak of NVM axioms since it is in another framework.

Our weakness is that we are working on a partial order and not a total order. 

Definition: vector is wrong, there are two objects not one. 

Write the growth rates as a function of g(x).

Axiom: It is not an axiom but a definition. I think that what we really have is lexicographicish preferences. 

The 100 vs 200 choice is purely descriptive, the actual explanation is not so. 

Dana explanation not clear.

Explain that ONE interpretation is that the gamble repeats, but this does not neccesarily need to be taken so.
