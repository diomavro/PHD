Which structure maximizes the number of producers? Claim: Possibly two lines

Consider a section with probababilities? 

Consider a two firm model where firms probabilistically are the ones whose turn it is. 

For instance with probability p, it's firm i's turn, with probability q, it's firm j's turn, with probability 1-q-p, the game ends and payoffs are realized.
