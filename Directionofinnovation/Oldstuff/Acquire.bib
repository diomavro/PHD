abstract = {Do the 'grand' strategic context characteristics of an acquisition (e.g., business relatedness of buyer and target) determine the integration success of R{\&}D functions after a takeover? Are acquisition management interventions (i.e., the way in which the integration process is managed) the key levers shaping integration success of R{\&}D functions after a change in corporate ownership? Little non-anecdotal empirical data are available to answer these questions. Therefore, they were addressed with a sample of 92 acquisitions between German firms in 1988. Overall, use of management interventions which were designed to promote learning opportunities and reduce uncertainty for acquired employees (e.g., small group meetings to exchange information) but also degree of centralization of strategic R{\&}D decisions in the hands of the acquirer were significantly positively related to integration level of R{\&}D functions of both firms after an acquisition. With the exception of relative size of acquiree, strategic acquisition context characteristics were not directly related to R{\&}D integration success. These characteristics may not be as important in shaping R{\&}D integration success as management practitioners and scholars have thought.},

abstract = {The main statement put forth by Coase in his essay on the problem of social cost (Coase, 1960) is that given zero transactions costs, the assignment of entitlements to perform actions that cause negative externalities does not prevent the agents from reaching an efficient outcome through bargaining. Coase's argument decisively depends upon the agents having resources to bargain. Since rents, understood as the return to a certain activity in excess of its opportunity cost, are natural providers of such resources, they play a vital role in the logic of the Coase theorem. It has been recently argued (Halpin, 2007) not only that Coase provides an incomplete analysis of rents but also that he is committed to a flawed argument over rents by neglecting the role of alternative activities. This paper recasts Coase's argument in the presence of rents and alternative activities to show that the theorem can be vindicated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We develop a model where competition discourages laggard firms from innovating but encourages neck-and-neck firms to innovate. Together with the effect of competition on the equilibrium industry structure, these generate an inverted-U. Two additional predictions of the model—that the average technologi- cal distance between leaders and followers increases with competition, and that the inverted-U is steeper when industries are more neck-and-neck—are both supported by the data.},

I find that firms engaging in acquisition activities are less innovative and have often experienced declines in technological innovation during the years prior to the bid. Among the bidders, the relatively more innovative ones are less likely to complete a deal. During the three years after the bid, successful bidders do not underperform matching firms, whereas failed bidders significantly underperform their nonbidding peers. I further find that formerly less innovative bidders benefit more from acquisitions. These findings suggest that technological innovation affects firms' acquisition decisions, and in turn, acquisitions help firms' innovation efforts.},

Our measures of corporate innovation capture both quantity and quality of innovation output, as well as the extent of asset complementarities that stem from technological overlaps between merger partners. We first show that more innovative companies are more likely to be acquirers, while less innovative companies are more likely to be acquired. Further, the existence of technological overlaps between any two firms has a positive and significant effect on merger pair formation. We then show that mergers are more likely to take place between firms with either technological or product market synergies, but less likely when both are present. Finally, using a quasi- experiment of failed merger bids, we show that acquirers with prior technological linkage with their target firms produce significantly higher innovation output after the merger. We conclude that technological overlaps are an important source of synergies behind corporate acquisitions.},

abstract = {We analyze how research and development (R{\&}D) outsourcing influences product innovation. We propose a separation between learning from R{\&}D outsourcing, whereby the firm improves its ability to innovate by using outsourced R{\&}D directly in new products, from learning by R{\&}D outsourcing, whereby the firm indirectly uses outsourced R{\&}D by integrating it with internal R{\&}D to create new products. Building on the knowledge-based view, we argue that learning from R{\&}D outsourcing is likely to have an inverse U-shaped relationship with product innovation, because the initial benefits of using outsourced component R{\&}D knowledge to innovate products is eventually outweighed by the hollowing out of the firm's ability to innovate. In contrast, we propose that learning by R{\&}D outsourcing is likely to have a U-shaped relationship with product innovation, because the initial challenges of integrating internal and external R{\&}D are eventually overcome, resulting in more innovations. Finally, we distinguish between domestic and foreign R{\&}D outsourcing and propose a liability of foreignness in R{\&}D outsourcing as it has a lower impact on new products than domestic R{\&}D outsourcing. The empirical analysis shows that outsourced R{\&}D has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the number of new products, while the interaction between outsourced R{\&}D and internal R{\&}D has a U-shaped relationship with the number of new products. It also shows that domestic outsourced R{\&}D has a higher positive impact on the number of new products than foreign outsourced R{\&}D.},
