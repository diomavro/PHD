can you add code so that it can be made into an executable
Yes, you can use the pyinstaller library to convert your python script into an executable file.

First, you will need to install pyinstaller by running pip install pyinstaller in your terminal or command prompt.

Then, in the same directory where your script is located, run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
pyinstaller --onefile scriptname.py
The --onefile option tells pyinstaller to create a single executable file, instead of a folder with multiple files. Replace scriptname.py with the actual name of your script.

After running the above command, a dist folder will be created in the same directory where your script is located. Inside the dist folder, you will find the executable file of your script.

You can then distribute this executable file to others, and they will be able to run it without needing to have python or your script installed on their machine.

Please note that, when using pyinstaller, the executable file will only work on the same type of operating system that it was created on.

Also, make sure that you have all the dependencies installed on the machine where you are creating the executable file, otherwise the executable file may not work on other machines.
