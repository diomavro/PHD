'''
write a program that fits the best model to a time series, for example the best ARIMA or GARCH
Here is an example of a Python program that uses the statsmodels library to fit an ARIMA model to a time series:
'''
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA

# Load the time series data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv')

# Fit an ARIMA model to the data
model = ARIMA(data, order=(2,1,1))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=False)

# Print the model's summary
print(model_fit.summary())
'''
This program uses the ARIMA class from the statsmodels.tsa.arima_model module to fit an ARIMA model to the time series data. The order parameter is used to specify the (p, d, q) values for the model, where p is the number of autoregressive terms, d is the number of differences, and q is the number of moving average terms.

The fit method is used to fit the model to the data, and the disp parameter is set to False to prevent the output from being displayed. The summary method is then used to print a summary of the model's results.

Similarly, you can use the GARCH model from the arch library to fit the GARCH model to your time series.

'''
from arch import arch_model

# Load the time series data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv')

# Fit a GARCH model to the data
model = arch_model(data, vol='GARCH', p=1, o=0, q=1)
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print the model's summary
print(model_fit.summary())
'''
Once you've fit the model you can use the forecast() method to make predictions with the fitted model.

Please note that, for the above code to work, you need to have the arch library installed, you can do this by running !pip install arch in your terminal or command prompt.

It is also important to keep
