The goal of this introduction will be to give the reader a general introduction
 to how economics treats property rights.
 We will give a brief exposition of the various methods by which economics
 justifies the granting of property rights.
 We will briefly first discuss the Coasian paradigm of property rights,
 and the Hart Moore property rights as well as some other views.
 We will then proceed to discuss how these approaches shed light on the
 economic justification of intellectual property rights and the limitations
 of such methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will then give a brief introduction to each article.
 The first article aims to show that even if it is desirable to give a monopoly
 on a good, this does not entail that property rights should also be used
 against consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second article uses the coase theorem but shows that the ability to
 negotiate for the buyout of innovations causes firms to pursue innovations
 that increase externalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third article is a general model of discounting, the aim of this paper
 is to show that it is possible to define discounting as something other
 than a preference, under this interpretation, the choices entrepreneurs
 make is not a function of their preferences but a function of their environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally the fourth model presents a general model of sequential innovation
 in a network in an aim to show that royalties are in fact subject to Bertrand
 like competition which.

\begin_layout Section
The origins of the debate about private property
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plato's most famous work, the Republic, is a treatise on an idealized society,
 one that has managed to halt to a minimum it's own deterioration from the
 perfect form.
 Plato's view of property rights is purely instrumental in that it is something
 that will help maintain the ideal society from deteriorating.
 Plato views ownership as an important source of corruption that creates
 clannish self interest and considerw the pannacea of this influence to
 be the abolition of private property, .

 Aristotle takes a stand against his mentor and defends private property.
 Aristotle reasons that without private property people would interfere
 in each others affairs without being motivated by love.
 Indeed Aristotle viewed the act of waiving your rights to property against
 an individual a way to be virtuous, and a limitation of this right would
 limit the ability to be virtuous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The debate has echoed for millennia, the modern reverbations of Plato and
 Aristotle are to be found in Marx and Locke, repsectivvely.
 At the time Marx was studying, the vogue of the times was to follow in
 Hegels footsteps who espoused a more limited version of dialectics(the
 process of thesis/antithesis/synethsis), and although Hegel ultimately
 defended property rights based on his theory of person-hood, stating that
 people are defined by their will and the only way to manifest their will
 is through physical objects, Marx would take the platonic position.
 Karl Marx claimed property rights is the means by which workers become
 alienated from their labor.
 The logic behind this is rather simple, if an employee adds 10 hours worth
 of labor, he will necessarily be compensated less than 10 hours worth by
 the property owner otherwise there would be no way of making a profit.
 The echo of Aristotle, found in Lockes' second treatise on Government takes
 a view of property that is both descriptive and normative.
 Locke views property rights as a method of linking a person who is adding
 value to that value.
 This is done by mixing one's labor with the object or land which makes
 the physical object inseparable from its founder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This debate has given rise to third paradigm of property rights devised
 by Henry George.
 In poverty and progress Henry George devised a system where property is
 temporarily allocated to the highest bidder.
 What is ingenious about the modern version of the Georgist scheme is that
 it aims to eliminate land rends by making tenants bid their own rents.
 This is claimed to be a method by which persons can be linked to the value
 of their labor without also be attached to the value of the land.
 The logic behind this is that if an agent knows he can gain 10 worth of
 value due to her own effort and 20 due to the land, this agent will be
 willing to pay 30.
 Since anybody can bid for this land, the minimum value people are willing
 to bid is 20(in the case when they cannot create value with the land).
 In other words, whatever the bidding mechanism, the agents minimum bid
 will be 20, which means the agent will not extract the value of the land
 for herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern economics has superceded much of the analysis that links value to
 labor.
 Value in the modern sense has been associated not with inputs but by the
 tastes of agents and the relative scarcity of resources and profit by the
 the relative advantage firms have in information, whether it be an edge
 in production, taste, impulses of consumers etc.
 This does not entail that property is disconnected from value, merely that
 value is not an objective criterion.
 In other words, the property is meant to protect the idiosyncatic priorities
 of its owner and not value as an objective right per se.
 Nevertheless modern economics is often concerned about efficiency and even
 with such a restrictive criterion as subjective value, a surprising number
 of conclusions are possible.
 Economics treats property rights like it treats most legal fields, as instrumen
ts to pareto or kaldor hicks or just brute utility maximization, as such
 the difference between property/tort/contract law is simply the kind of
 laws that are tweeked to achieve the same outcomes.

 From an economics point of view the answer is quite simple: A property
 right is simply the default contract, that is, if people do not agree on
 a contract, property is what is taken as the baseline for settling disputes.
 'Property as the default' view is simple enough: Person A can contract
 with person B that person B will not touch or use item Z without A's permission.
 This in fact requires no property right at all.
 What does require a property right is that all other people will also not
 be able to do with z as they please.
 If agents could all simultaneously consent or if there were but two agents
 who could contract, there would be no need for property rights.
 This inability to instantly discuss and resolve conflict with every individual
 is called a transaction cost, this concept will be elaborated below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The language of property rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discussion of property rights can be broken down into four distinct questions.
 1) What are the assets that property rights protects? 2) From who is the
 property protected? 3) What is the content of property protection.
 4) What is the enforcement mechanism by which property is to be protected.
 Because answering these questions often lacks precision we use some legal
 language

.
 It is convenient to speak of two categories of rights.
 First order rights and second order rights.
 First order rights are what is often called, the right to use or the right
 to exclude.
 The right to use is often called a

privilege
\begin_inset ERT

 and the right to exclude is called a

\end_layout

\end_inset

claim
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Second order rights are rights about first order rights.
 For instance when one talks of

\end_layout

power
\begin_inset ERT

 this is in reference to the right to transfer, waive or annul

\end_layout

\end_inset

claim
\begin_inset ERT

 rights.
 As such, the right to transfer property to someone else is a second order
 right.
 One can also speak of

\end_layout

\end_inset

immunity
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which means that one has the right for his claim or privilege to something
 to not be affected by others.
 The idea of second order rights entirely entails the right to destroy and
 to abandon, if someone does not have second order rights this entails the
 agent has no right to destroy or abandon.

 Historically it seems like most ancient societies had widespread first
 oder rights but it is only in the period preceeding the industrial revolution
 that second order rights have have been expanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To develop some intuition it isuseful to know how this taxonomy matches
 with traditional economic ideas: A law that requires property owners to
 allow access to some parties, this is a limitation of the first order right

 limitation, that is the condition under which ones transfers his right
 is limited; A constitutional constraint increasing the cost of changes
 in property rights is an example of a second order right of immunity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the types of arrangements possible(corporations, partnerships,
 non-profits, licenses, bailments, non-voting common stock, trusts, agencies,
 employee-employer relationships marriages etc) entirely depend on theabove
 taxonomy.
 For instance a company is predicated on second order rights, the ability
 to transfer assets to a non-(physically)existing entitiy is a relatively
 new right.
 The notion of an economic transaction is alsoentirely explained by the
 above categories.
 A transaction is inherently about the exchange of rights and the kind of
 rights an agent has entirely specifies what he can contract over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this in mind we clarify how some property right paradigms fit into
 this conceptual framework, though these terms have a widely divergent definitio
ns, the purpose here is to use them with the above definitions, property
 is characteristic of assets.
 If it is said that an asset is private property, that means that it is
 associated with the groups of rights associated with private property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 is a regime granting full first order rights and immunity.
 For instance someone may have a right to use and the right to exclude,
 and no institution has a right to reduce these rights.
 Since individuals have no right to transfer, the decision of transfering
 is left to the state, many historical regimes have given personal property
 rights to families or the first born to avoid confusions upon death.

.
 This definition of private property has the advantage of setting an objective
 standard and requires no reference to subjective clauses.
 However most economists prefer the definition of property rights that follows
 the form

the right to do with your property as you wish as long as nobody else is

, one need only notice how ambiguous this standard is if the question is
 about the right of someone to build a skyscraper given that it blocks the
 view of a neighbor.
 The former definition actually has a much less ambiguous notion of externality
 but much of theory has been built on the latter definition.

 the state exercises its second order rights.

Georgian system of property
\shape default
.
 The Georgian system of property is a system which temporarily grants first
 order rights to individuals.
 The system does not have discretion like public property has, however,
 second order rights like power and immunity are still in the hands of the
 state, as such it is merely about how the state decides to use, which is
 simply to create an auction for temporary rental.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is the change in allocation of rights substantive? In other words is this
 whole exercise just a redefinition but does not imply any changes in resulting
 actions? We will see that depending on the structure of the economy, the
 kind of rights bestowed can have drastically different effects, even if
 the pursuit of goals is identical(eg, profits/charity).

 can lead to the agent choosing differently.
 For instance in the price control case, if an agent is bounded at how high
 a rent he can charge for an apartment he may prefer childless/petless adults
 to avoid noise or damage to his property, similarly if the future revenue
 is lower then he might not invest to renew it and prefer some alternative
 investment.
 In other words, limitation of power has important allocative effects and
 investment effect.

\begin_layout Section
The economic value of static property rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The economics way of tackiling the effects of property rights leans on two
 kinds of efficiency: allocative efficiency and investment efficiency.
 Allocative efficiency means either to give it to the agent who values it
 the most or the agent who has the lowest cost to operate it.
 Both of these dynamic notions require the static concepts of value.
 Value in economics is usually described by market value and subjective
 value.
 These notions are important in that the whole framework of analyzing property
 rights leans on their interaction.
 We quickly analyze some cases of how these notions interact.
 One of the achievement of economics is the deduction of the market value
 of an asset by the description of the subjective value.
 Note that a positive market value does not imply that exchange occurs,
 indeed subjective value is key to whole framework of the optimal allocation
 of property rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Identical and strictly positive subjective value for all agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an asset has an identical positive value for all agents then it has a
 positive market value but no exchange occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Identical and null value for all agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose an asset has zero subjective value for all agents, then it also
 has zero market value because nobody is willing to buy it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Identical and negative value for all agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the market value is negative and the allocation of property rights
 just means, 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

who will be targeted to receive this asset
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In such a case, there is a demand for abandonment or destruction.
 The decision whether to force the ownership of the asset to occur should
 depend on whether the asset is best left abandoned or destroyed, if the
 optimal use of the asset is its destruction then ownership should be forced,
 if its optimal use is abandonment then no property right is necessary.
 Of course there may also be a situation when one requires someone to own
 something without giving that person the right to abandon or destroy(keys).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Variable and weakly positive value for all agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose now that we introduce variance into the mix.
 If agents have differential positive value for the asset, then a positive
 market value exists and an exchange occurs unless the highest value user
 is one who is allocated the property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Variable and weakly negative value for all agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hot potato: Similarly if all agents have a differential negative value of
 the good then there is still a value market value to the good unless the
 highest value user owns it.
 This is because if anyone other than the highest value user owns the good,
 they would be willing to pay the highest value user to own it.
 In this case they would consider the lowest cost alternative between subsidizin
g the highest value user to own it versus destroying it or abandoning it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Variable, positive and negative value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some difficulty arises when we mix the cases, for instance if the distribution
 of subjective value include both positive and negative values, then clearly
 if transaction costs are zero then there will occur a trade if the good
 is given to anyone but the highest value user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of analysis implicitely takes into account many things.
 For instance if there are n objects the price only needs to be high enough
 to deter n+1 highest valuation agent from purchasing(this does not rule
 out that an agent may have two of the highest valuations because she has
 utility for two of the goods).
 As such the distribution of prices sold depends on both the number of buyers
 and and the number of objects.
 If there is but one buyer, then extreme value theory may describe the price
 realizations, if there are always half as many objects as as agents and
 agents only have use of one item then the distribution of prices will represent
 the median valuation.

\begin_layout Standard
The above above, assumes a zero transaction cost environment.
 A transaction cost can be defined as the cost associated with accessing
 the market value.
 If there are transaction costs then, the question of making destruction
 or abandonment illegal become relatively more attractive because with transacti
on costs there may be efficiency losses due to over-destruction or over-abandonm
ent.There is also the question of liquidity constraints(also called pecuniary
 externality), if the agents find themselves liquidity constrained then
 we cannot the distribution of subjective value from prices alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One must then ask what the relationship of property rights is to the creation
 of other property rights.
 For instance suppose some agent bids for some asset A that also has some
 other asset B attached to it, should the agent get property rights over
 the second asset, B.
 In a zero transaction cost world, perfect information world, the answer
 is, it does not matter for allocational efficiency.
 Perhaps a more concrete example is the discovery of oil in one's backyard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Value does not neccesarily stem from an object directly, it can stem from
 complementarity between the object and something else.
 For instance the value of an object may coincidentally come the kind of
 work that can be done with the object.
 This kind of complication does not in fact change anything in the above
 analysis, however it does lead us to the concept of time which can complicate
 the analysis.

\begin_layout Section
Dynamic creation of property rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most important concept in economics is the allocation of property
 rights on things that do not exist initially but exist eventually.
 For instance if someone buys an object and either because of the characteristic
s of the object or because the user did something to the obejct, a new asset
 is created.
 If the rights to the new asset also belong to the agent then the implications
 are clear: if the asset is created conditional on some action the agent
 will take that action or auction off the right to take that action to somebody
 who has a lower cost associated with that action or if the cost is too
 high will just not create the asset.
 If the asset is created unconditionally then the agent would have evaluated
 as a bundle of two assets.
 This conditionality in the creation of property rights is perhaps the most
 important question in economics, we illustrate below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conditionality in property rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above analysis is sufficient when there is no question of dynamic creation
 of property rights.
 The problem occurs when assets generate other assets.
 For instance if a piece of land is found to generate a certain natural
 gas then the question naturally arises, 'does the owner of the land also
 own the gas?' It seems intuitive that if one owns a dog, they also own
 the puppies of that dog.
 On the other hand, it is less clear how the ownership of wild animals is
 to be treated.
 For instance if a deer is owned, then presumably the usual rules of asset
 allocational efficiency hold, he will keep the deer if his subjective value
 is higher than the market value.
 If on the other hand, the deer is owned conditionally on being on the land,
 then this creates incentives for fencing the deer in as long as the deer
 has a higher subjective or market value than zero.
 If deer is only owned if killed, then this creates an incentive to kill
 it.
 If land is lost conditionally on having deer on it, then this creates an
 incentive to kill/abandon or sell the deer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case where all property rights are allocated a priori, the above
 analysis is correct.
 However in the real world, much of the complexity of property rights arises
 because in practice new property rights are constantly being created and
 strategic or competitive action occurs because of the creation of property
 rights

Conditionality, can tell us a lot about the effects of private property.
 For instance Locke's theory that something is owned conditionally on mixing
 ones labor with it, whilst a moral theory, from the point of view of economics
 has descriptive content in the sense that such a property rights paradigm
 incentivizes people to put their labor into things.

 From the point of view of productivity this is not necessarily optimal
 since this would encourage effort but not output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The economic question for allocational and investment efficiency then becomes
 interwined on the conditionality of property rights.
 Many of the problems that economists perceive are not necessarily about
 property rights themselves but about the procedure of the creation of property
 rights.
 For instance in the tragedy of commons, the issue is not that there are
 no property rights on land but that there are property rights on fish condition
al on fishing them.
 This leads to three solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tragedy of the commons is a special case of conditional property rights
 on action.
 For instance if we define action as fishing/hunting/drilling etc.
 We can then say that if people wish to acquire property rights they are
 incentivized to take the action, especially when not taking the action
 does not grant property rights.
 The tragedy of the commons arises when first order rights and second right
 order rights are granted conditionally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course if there are no conditional property rights at all.
 No matter what action you do, you cannot get property rights on the fish,
 then this immediately eliminates the tragedy of the commons because there
 will be no overfising, this will also result in no fishing at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tragedy of the commons disappears with a number property right regimes,
 what they have in common is elimination of some sort of conditionality.
 For instance if fishing does not give you the right to sell(power) the
 fish but gives you the right to use(privilege) it, then whether the level
 of fishing depends entirely on the cost of fishing and the demand for fishing,
 the problem then becomes purely a problem of population, clearly as the
 population increases it causes increases in fishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively the priori setting of property rights(for animals, this could
 be branding), that is before action is taken, also does not lead to a tragedy
 of the commons.
 To see why consider an agent who is considering whether to fish his fish
 or not.
 Clearly the price of fish will drop if everyone fishes this period, so
 it may be optimal to delay fishing until next period.
 Additionally if a priori rights are set so that the owner of the fish owns
 any fish stemming from the fish, this will cause the agent to consider
 the future value of his fish as even more valuable.
 This will lead to a more sustainable steady state of fishing per period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of public property rights often the conditionality is on geography.
 For instance if some property's fruits are shared based on some geographical
 specification, this incentivizes entering the geographical area in question.
 In a sense the only way to sell one's share in the property is to move.
 In other words dilution of ones share is decided by the public property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of private property a similar dilution may occur in the case
 of stock ownership, but it is usually for an associated sum with the idea
 of increasing the value of the shares held by investors by more than their
 dilution.
 In other words, when production plays a role, property is best attributed
 more directly to the people who are responsible for the production, this
 could be because they have knowledge of how to use it, or because they
 have some characteristic, such as risk bearing ability which would create
 higher productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To take an example, suppose that some person can produce k units if he were
 to work on a specific asset.
 Suppose there are 10 assets and 20 citizens.
 The citizens own assets equally, so each citizen owns 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

 .
 If a citizen can work on a specific asset to produce 20 units of a good,
 then he will only receive 1 of those goods in the end.
 Which means his willingness to expend effort is 1.
 If on the other hand, the assets are redistributed in such a way that every
 citizen still owns 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

 but the the citizens own higher shares of the assets they work on, if for
 example that same citizen had 
\begin_inset Formula $10\%$
\end_inset

 share of the asset he worked on then, his willingness to expend effort
 had doubled.
 In other words, we can say that the distribution of ownership does NOT
 matter if every citizen works on every asset and their productivity of
 every citizen is the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make ownership of an asset illegal is to make its market value zero or
 negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Coasian view of property rights claims that allocative efficiency is
 in fact irrelevant as long as there are no transaction costs and barganing
 is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question of what assets property rights protects can be quite complex.
 Some possible categories to consider, are tangible vs intangible; the ratio
 of subjective value to market value.
 One could also have alienable vs inalienable.
 Or one could define assets as having market value, in this formulation
 an asset only acquires property rights when it has accumulated sufficient
 components to acquire either subjective or market value.
 The market value component could also be used to justify the scope of protectio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that positive market value exists only if at least one non-possessor
 of the good has a subjective value for it.
 If the only person with positive subjective value of the good acquires
 it, then by definition the good no longer has market value.
 It is also possible for a good to have negative market value or subjective
 value.
 If the possessor of the good has a negative subjective value of the good
 AND no property rights to it, then the person is likely to either destroy
 it or abandon it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a good only has value for a single person, then it has no market value.
 If it has value for more than a single person then it does have market
 value.

Externalities

\begin_layout Standard
To define the Coase theorem we need the concept of externalities.
 Externalities are usually defined on a set of actions, it is when an action
 of A, has an effect on anybody else but A.
 Contracts can be framed as trying to create incentives for positive externaliti
es, in other words to increase the payoff of an agent by A by taking a specific
 action.

\begin_layout Standard
The coasian view of property rights aims to explain or justify property
 through two categories.
 Transaction costs and negative externalities.
 The Coasian approach has a simple statement of the form: externalities
 will only matter if transaction costs are large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If ownership and possession are not identical, this creates the possibility
 of temporary transfer of assets to higher value users or to lower cost
 producers.
 Similarly there is the investment efficiency from stable ownership, this
 is asset related skills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of assets is not only direct, it can be expected to increase the
 value of other assets that are complementary to the asset itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also of course a subjective value from ownership.
 For instance, suppose an owner who does not intend to use the asset but
 intends to rent it forever.
 If this owner discounts, the asset merely represents a series of cash flows,
 for which he should able to exchange a lump sum for.
 If we suppose that someone prefers to own rather than rent, liquidity is
 only constraint for transfer to occur.
