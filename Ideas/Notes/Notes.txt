It may appear that 'essentials' should be compensated more than non-essentials. 

However, if you take into account the suppliers, this is not really workable. Indeed, if non-essentials suffer from a more varied demand, it makes sense that they have to charge more so they can survive in times of crisis. 

In essence essentials are low variance demand, and non-essentials are high variance demand. So why would somebody choose the higher variance? Two reasons, they have some hurdle they must overcome(a La savage) or the mean is higher. 

This is similar to the specific inputs have more variance than non-specific inputs.
