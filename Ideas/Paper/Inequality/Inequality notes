Structure


What is the open society? A society that can adjust from the zombie apocalypse to the raining of food and water without a change in legislation. 

The problem with idiots of the here and now is that 

Part 1: Equality, 
a) The arguments for equality
b) Why those arguments imply homogeneity. 
Part 2: Global Problems
Climate change ideology
Part 3: The EU, 
a) Monotonicity in influence

Notes from the nonsese that guy SFcliffe showed me

Claim 1: Inequality causes life expectancy differences. There is no empirical evidence for this claim. Accepting this inference is like accepting that access to health institutions is NOT the cause. 

So then he goes on to say, relative income matters, in other words, people are jealous therefore income inequality is bad? 

First of all, if this is really a problem of perception, then presumably you think that if there was zero information about people's wealth or your ranking, nothing would occur? This is clearly false, for example, entrepreneurs live longer yet earn less?

3.30 he weights every index equally... 

Next, it is clear that his sample is not randomly selected

Claim 2: Wealth taxes solve the problems. 

Claim 3: The causes of inequality are not good

On inequality

The simpler argument to me is that there are some people who care about relative status more or less than others. Those who care about absolute status care only about enough, those who only care about relative richness. 
1) Threshold logic. If you need more than x to survive or to live happily, then equality is sub-optimal. 
2) Gluttony is offensive
3) Reduce both poverty and excessive affluence, suppose that rich people had no differences in consumption to middle-class people, would we care? Inequality has externalities on electoral and regulatory procedures. 
4) Economic equality is pulled out as important, but "the same" is not as important as "enough"
5) Even if it is not important it might be instrumentally important, aka if we focus on inequality we will implicitly target things we do care about. If economic sufficiency is the goal, equality may still be the right way to go about it. (Would we care by equality we were not discussing survival but about the comfort of couches?)
6) Makes people not ask the question, "what can make me happy?" but has to frame it in terms of equality, that is, it is alienating. 
7) Creates shallowness because it makes people focus on economic status, which creates moral orientation and shallowness.
8) The more important daily question is what do I need to have enough? The distraction makes us lose focus from the hard question by diverting us into an easy question(just divise)
9) How DO PEOPLE argue for equality? They argue that causes social status or ability to use opportunities and political influence
10) Marginally diminishing utility, requires that for each individual, the utility of money diminishes at the margin, and everyone has the same utility function
11) Transferring money, may not actually change anything because of inflation. For instance, if there are 20 units of a good, and this is what that person will spend it on if he has the money, then as long as his relative status is unchanged, this will not lead him to get more. The good that he WILL buy will probably increase in price, meaning that somebody else will buy less of it. 
12) Both 10 hypothesis, are wrong. The second one is more interesting because if we do adapt to levels of consumption, then what really matters is the possibility to spike it. But the first one is also not really good because money is exactly that good which has infinite versatility. So the versatility of goods matters

13) There are goods where we also increase our enjoyment from repetition. Acquired tastes or sports, it cannot be assumed that every segment of the curve must have a downward slope. 
14) Utility thresholds, it may be worthwhile to save so that you can buy the next tier item up. 
15) Loss aversion, not about marginal utility but about disutility of harms. Instead of marginally increasing the quality of your steak it might be best to just save more and go see the game
16) Goods are complements, this means marginal utility may not apply. A marginal increase in income may have more of an effect because POPcorn and butter
17) Collector
18) 18 survival example, scarcity, what if the last unit is not perfectly divisible
19) Same
20) It is not true that if you give something to someone who has less than enough, it makes them better off
21) We are disturbed by people not having enough, NOT by people having less



22) Draw attention to differences in consumption between the rich and poor
23) Comparing the incomes of two people says nothing about whether their needs are satisfied or unsatisfied 
24) What does it mean to say someone has enough? That is, what does it mean to say that there is such a limit? Enough, is about standards and not about limits? ????????????

25) It is not always clear that more money will alleviate the circumstances of sufficiency. There are rich people who dissatisfied and poor people who are dissatisfied. It may be that a poor person will be dissatisfied even with more money whilst a rich person will be more satisfied. Many rich people are prepared to sacrifice leisure for more money, why can we not take this as a revealed preference?
26) If someone is content, there is no particularly eagerness to improve their lives, they can probably improve their life but they are content as they are. Of course, he prefers to have more than less, but the active interest is always there
27) Rationality entails that maximizing satisfaction. Why would somebody say no? Because he is already maximizing his level of satisfaction. We would not criticize a man for saying he is satisfied with a woman, probably he even prefers NOT to compare her to other women. 
28) Is it honorable or dishonorable to be content with your current resources? He merely prefers to devote his evaluations to an intrinsic appraisal of his life. 

morgan: possibility, chance

variance matters for income,

post thots: Without diminishing marginal utility, there is very little to want inequality. Suppose we have a utility function that requires people to want to be the best at something for them to get utils. If there is no chance to be the best at something they are less happy. 

If inequality matters in itself then we should be willing to sacrifice something for it. For instance if we are not willing to increase the proportion of poor people, or if we are not willing to sacrifice liberty, or whatever, then in essence you cannot make the argument that it is worth something.

Opportunity

Let's say somebody is born to be an actor, and somebody else is born to be a mathematician. Let's say that society actually has much more demand for mathematicians than actors, that is, they can find many more positions to place mathematicians in than actors. Does this actor and this mathematician have the same opportunity to achieve their goal? Does the statement they must have the same opportunity to achieve their dreams make any normative sense? Is it not clear that the mathematician will have a better opportunity of achieving his goal? 

What does it really add to the conversation to say "yeah but if the actor wanted to be a mathematician, he should have had the same chances as the mathematician." Of course this view is mistaken because it assumes that he COULD have the same affinity or that the parenting would not matter. So let's try and adjust their argument to exclude natural deviations, "okay but if a person was born with the same potential skills as somebody else and he had the same parenting then he should be able to get as far as the other", but what if one person is born into a society that needs more mathematicians than somewhere else? Say the math teacher in some village just died and there is suddenly a demand for a new mathematician, is meaningful to say that the math kid in different towns should have the same chance of being a mathematicians? Is this not an attempt to destroy the effects of geography? Okay so let's revise it again to take into account the nurture of parents, the genetics innateness of the kid and the geographic location. 

Okay what about temperament? SHould we control for that? Surely we wish to say that a kid which has a temperament that is better suited to achieve will not have the same chance as a kid which has the other.

So "If somebody else was born in the exact same place and had all the same potential and the same character, same parenting effects they should have the same chances of achieving what they want to achieve.". , this is beginning to sound like a tautology but there is one thing missing, why would two kids with all the same things above have difference chances? The only difference must be wealth. So  we now have a clearer vision of what it means to be for equality of opportunity, to be against inheritance. Why is inheritance a good thing? This will be the topic of the next chapter. 

Hierarchy is not in itself a bad thing. It is natural, indeed, is it so offensive to think that some families will train their kids to do something better than others? The only repugnant thing is FORMAL hierarchies, that is, the system structured so that those who come from certain places abasolutely CANNOT do some things. Formal hierarchies exist in France, where Maitre de conferences or Foncionnaire have unconditional salaries in virtue of their education.

All this inequality talk is actually very tiring. It is blatantly obvious that people are having an aesthetic reaction to it and trying to put "science" behind their aesthetic reaction. There is seldom any point in listening to people who are trying to prove their aesthetic reaction. If your "ought" does not already imply the policy proposal, then at least you know that the idea of "science" is in the pursuit of trying to understand the causes of your ought.

Moral values vs aesthetic values

premise a: The willingness to pay is proportional to wealth
premise b: Firms have full information and can discriminate
a and b: imply that wealth inequality does not matter. 

Before existing vs after existing and a priori equality. What existence tells.us about economics. 

Chomsky defended the Khmer Rouge, Mao, The viet Minh(who tried to enslave their own people), Venezuelan Socialism, and the Soviets(before 1980s). Its hard to imagine one person getting so many big things wrong...yet somehow he is still admired by some.

How not to make inferences about wealth inequality. A rich person might just use his money on services, he might be saving for a rainy day. 

Where can money be spent? If someone can't spend it anywhere then it can't control much. 

Maybe make an example how a VAT tax ACTUALLy taxes resource inequality.

The vocabulary in France is so entrenched in egalitarianism you can't even have a discussion on political issues.  'Justice' and "equality" are treated as equivalent. No wonder the only counter-narrative with teeth is nationalism. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I sometimes wonder how people can enter into this kind of discourse. Let's take the arguments one by one:
Labour share fell. Okay but what does labor share depend on? The structure of production, NOT the ownership. 

The fact that wages rose less than GDP growth. What does this actually imply? You do realize that if the means of production are owned by the state, then the capital share should be going to the state and then re-distributed. It doesn't actually mean that the capital share will go directly to labor, unless you are implying that salaries should go up until there are no profits, which would create a massive wage inequality between capital intensive and non-capital intensive industries. 

The nazi regime was known for its state-directed enterprises. In other words, "do what we ask or we confiscate it". If you want to show that the private ownership LED to those practices you must show that  those practices existed before Hitler. 

Even Lenin recognized that profit was important once the labor first labor camps started going, in fact this was what was meant by making labor camps "self sufficient". 

High car production... means what exactly? You do realize that

Notes on equality of opportunity

Is it possible to make this principle coherent? Proposition 1: everyone born everywhere should have the same opportunity to achieve anything. 

Objection 1: this makes everywhere the same

Objection 2: what about natural differences?

Fail.

Proposition 2: make sure that if a talented person was born into a poor family he would have the same chances as if he was born in the rich family.

Objection 1: this means that we must homogenize the parenting environment, in other words that parents have must have no effect on their childrens outcome. Or just confiscate children from their parents. 

Objection2: this implies no inheritance of capital, because if capital has some effect on the probability of achieveming something then no chances would occur. 

Note: if we try to stop the inheritance we reduce the incentive to preserve capital. Wasteful spending would tempt us to reduce the accumulation of capital, therefore we would prevent people from ever accumuting capital, welcome to communism. 

Proposition 3: everyone must have an equal opportunity to achieve at least x amount.

Objection: this is a meaningless proposition because no criteria are given as to what this x should be. 

Lets say that there was some group in the population which magically received a heavenly gift that cannot be distributed, they are the only one that can use it. Lets say this gift makes them more productive, should they be able to use it? I would be quite surprised if the answer to this was "depends which portion of the population got it, if its the rich, then no, if its the poor then yes"

Income equality causes homogeneity.  We need only imagine that everyone wants to live by the beach. The house supplier can sell either lots of small houses by the beach or some large houses by the beach and some small ones farther away. 

Equality is an ethic for the government not for individuals. 

Equality is a really odd universalizing principle. If I had to guess, I would say that it comes from a deep instinct in humans to want to make the world like themselves. 

The call to equality is usually a signal of ignorance. E.G. all religions are the same, is usually uttered by those who have not studied any but have dabled in new age guru bullshit.
