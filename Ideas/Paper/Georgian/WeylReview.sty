What is the probability of a public good problem?
\end{abstract} 
\end{mdframed}


The basic problem of the Georgian Bidding scheme described is that it favors investment over a certain time horizon. Since an asset is not retained after period AB unless one wins the bet, this in effect means that agents only have an incentive to invest in assets that can be used regardless of location OR invest in assets that come to fruition early. In addition agents have an incentive to hide their land improvements. Worse yet, this incentivizes exploitation, of the worse form. 

In other words, the scheme discourages cooperation, as any leakage of information, doesn't just cost the firm the cost efficient technology, it potentially also causes the firm to lose control of its land. 




\section{Diversity}

The problem is that Weyl doesn't even attempt to retain the functionality of private property. Weyl writes that private property is not OPTED into in the first place, as such it seems justified to move to another system as well. But this misses that private property is the only knon system which, even if not opted into, allows agents to OPT out of further forceful imposition. Indeed private property allows communities to be independent of political and social trends. 


A grand confusion about the function of private property is the diversity it enables. Once a community figures out how to NOT depend on things outside of its domain, it allows communities to develop their own norms and evolve in their own independent paths. 

The problem of the economist is the readiness with which he imposes the profit constraint. While we can understand the importance of the profit constraint in the context of evolutionary forces of profit and loss, this is in fact, an intermediate stage. Indeed when one has not found a sustainable lifestyle, firms profits represent the enabling of other agents to search for their ends. But the goal of most people is not to always be subject to the market forces, indeed, many people only have to be slaves to the market process until they can figure out how to survive independly of the market process. 

The market process is the imposition of the measure by which one can gain independence. That measure, is money, or prices. 

Private property is the domain where agents can choose which measure to apply. For instance, one may judge the measure to be, how much plant surface it has, or may be the amount of ritualistic dance or a complex interaction of the two. This measure can create its own sub-competition. For instance, hunting tribe might decide that the mode of competition is how much elk is hunted, or an Amish community may decide that the measure of competition is productivity of crops, one may even decide that the measure of competition is the love displayed towards others. 

The natural measure of competition is violence. Indeed, this is often what democracy is about. 

Of course a property right is more than the selection of measure. It is also the right NOT to optimize. 



If two people have different values, that is, they have a specific structure/function that they want to maintain for a property. To maintain this structure they must either minimize their interaction with other functions or structures OR make their individual structure less costly. 

In fact you also choose your own measure about how to judge whether the property is going well or not.

\section{Impressions}

Note that I was not aware of the Georgian tax system before this book so in a way I am thankful for this book because I think it helped me learn a lot. 

\section{Definitional issues}

Liberalism is merely a word that is used to refer to the liberals such as Adam Smith, these strange definition employed such as "sovereignty of the individual" or "liquidity and inequality" are quite literally "concept creep". Trying to sneak in your ideology by co-opting words. 

Markets are a word we use to describe free exchange and flexible prices under private property. It is not a "tool" or anything magic like that, in fact a market is no more a tool than people interacting is a tool. People interacting to exchange coffee mugs for carrots, is a market... is it meaningful to say that this exchange is a tool? Only in so far that you want to participate in it to get something you want. However clearly when people use the word "tool" what they want to say is "I want to use people's interactions when it suits me and not use it when it does not suit me"

Weyl made a very specific empirical claim which was that private property rights were stronger in France and that prevented the industrial revolution from emerging in France. 

Note that the liquidity problem is solved in Coase by merely shifting the rule to the person whose valuation is the most illiquid. Property rights enable Pareto transactions. 

For the democracy thing, who decides the scale? Why is this not coalition proof?

GMOS? If it IS true that GMO's are more profitable, you are quite literally creating the eradication of non-gmo. The general argument is, if something has the same marginal cost but a higher fixed cost, this will not be undertaken. Even if this higher fixed cost is willingly undertaken. 

\section{Outline of criticism}

Suppose there are two agents, one agent has a valuation of 100 but has a productive output of 50 with the asset. The other agent has a has private value of 75 and a productive value of 75. 

The auction will then result in an inn-efficiency of allocations.

A loan will not allow the agent to work around this because, or at least, the more the agent values things in an unmonetizeable way, the more impossible it is for him/her to actually make investments. In other words, we are really creating the equilibrium where subjective value is dominated by market value. 

A second criticism of democratic quadratic voting is that there is no mechanism by which you can prevent people from proposing terrible policy proposals in an effort to destroy the accumulated votes of others. 

The mechanism design criticism takes two forms. First, with liquidity constraints, the usual efficiency problems of mechanism design start to hold. On the other hand we ALSO have the trivial winners curse problem here, that is, the most optimistic person will win the bid. For some reason it is will established that finance, silly investors are a reneweable resource but NOT in this scheme. 

Another point here is that private property is informationally robust mechanism. If there is uncertainty about the quality of the land, in any form, the scheme does not work. For instance, there could be learning by doing mechanisms at work. 

\section{Salvage}

Can the same scheme be used by firms? The limitation of the scheme is that it does not discriminate between land with high allocational value and low investment value and land with high investment value and low allocational value. 

However presumably if a firm decides that a piece of land has high allocational value but low investment value and it values its own capacity to allocate to be less costly than the other firm, then this firm can bid more for it than other firms. Once the firm owns all the lands with high allocational value and low investment value

A second thing that I find salvageable is that the distinction between allocational and investment efficiency does not really exist in the intellectual property domain or at least does not really exist in the sense required. 

Suppose a firm has the intellectual asset of star wars. What does it mean for an author to be the allocational optimal? Well it means that this person can make the most from his labor. So while for instance another writer working on star wars can create a product worth 80 dollars(with the estate tax included). The optimal author can make a product worth 100. 

Now there are two avenues to advance here. 

First, what does it mean for the author to be the optimal allocation? Is the distinction between investment and allocational efficiency really something worthwhile? Well lets see, if he is the person who will make the most money off of it, what does it mean? If it means he will make the movie that will be the most successful then it is clear. What about investment efficiency? What does it mean for the system to be investment efficient? What does it mean to invest in the property in the intellectual context? Maybe it is to develop the world? Is there somebody who is developing the world he is creating without also being the allocationally optimal person? For instance George Rr Martin, may be, (debateably) the best person to improve the intellectual property, however what does this even mean? Does it mean that the property is increasing in value? How can it increase in value independently of the sales? Clearly if he develops the story but nobody reads it, then the value of the property has not increased. Indeed the property actually only increases in value according to sales, this means that allocational efficiency and investment efficiency are in fact interchangeable in the intellectual property domain. 

Second, it should be noted that we assume that the increase in capital efficiency is not important. What does this mean? Well suppose that there are two ways of using the property, a capital intensive way and a non-capital intensive way. If the capital is attached to the property, that is if the property is allocated to someone else WITH the property, then the allocated individual will be indifferent between the two methods, even if the capital intensive method actually gets a much higher output. 
Suppose that the capital is NOT part of the land but that it is also up for auction. What does this mean now? Well I would only bid for it according to how much it will augment my labor productivity on the land. However if it only augments my labor absolutely but it increases the labor productivity of EVERYONE in the same way, then I cannot be allocated the good, there has to be a DOUBLE coincidence for me to actually use this capital on the land, I have to both be the highest bidder on both. So the incentive to actually make this capital is the difference between MY capital augmentation and the SECOND persons capital augmentation. 

What if people can keep their capital as private property? Well here we have the incentive to invest that is at least the labor enhancing portion of the capital. Why? Suppose that this capital will also be land enhancing, then clearly this person will ALSO be able to extract the capital share from the land. In other words even if someone is unproductive in terms of labor, they may be the most productive from the capital point of view. 


\section{Conclusion}

At the end of the day we should approach the subject of economics with a little bit of humility. That is we are here in our own little world trying to solve esoteric efficiency arguments. This author finds it incredible that we can honestly believe that at the end of out deliberation we will have concluded something that may give us the moral authority to out into the world and displace people according to what our scheme has decided works best. Indeed, this is the difference between the platonic ideal of "experts" as controllers of society as opposed to the liberal ideal where experts are advisors, encouraging people to try certain things because they think those things may work better for the people than others, but would never dream of imposing their will in such a manner.
