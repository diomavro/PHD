'''
This program uses the pandas library to load historical S&P500 data into a DataFrame, the backtesting library to backtest a moving average crossover trading strategy, and the numpy library to calculate the moving averages. The strategy is to buy when a 20-day moving average crosses above a 50-day moving average, and sell when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 20-day moving average. The output() function returns the summary of the backtest results.

Please note that, for the above code to work, you need to have the backtesting library installed, you can do this by running !pip install backtesting in your terminal or command prompt. Also, you need to have a csv file containing the S&P500 data in the same directory with the name 'SP500.csv'
