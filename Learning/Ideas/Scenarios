Say I show you a graph and then I predict what that graph will look like. In the next 10 years, but suppose that that graph has say 10 scenarios. Is this scientific? 

Only if I ALSO specify under what conditions each scenario will occur. In other words, if there is some OTHER variable that I cannot predict then I have to condition on that other variable. But if I do not specify the conditions at all and simply label my scenarios A, B, C, then it is clearly pseudo science. 

1) People have different goals they want to achieve. 
2) Some of those goals are mutually exclusive. 
3) Property sets the domain where you are allowed to pursue those goals. 
4) Rawls puts a hierarchy on other goals (Eating is more important than sailing the world, so I can don't mind sacrificing your sailing the world dream)

It seems to me like distributional "justice", is either Macro in the sense that Rawls uses it: puts a hierarchy on different functions. 
Or Micro, where it is neutral between functions, instead it enforces property rights, which merely means that people can PLAN to achieve those goals.
