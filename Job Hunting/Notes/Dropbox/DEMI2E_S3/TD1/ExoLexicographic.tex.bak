\section*{Exercise: Lexicographic preferences }
\textit{The preferences' rationality:}

The completeness is immediate since $\geq $ is a total order and if two elements of $ \mathbb{R} $ are different, one is greater than the other.

If $ x \succeq y $ and  $ y \succeq z $, then we have to deal with several cases. If $ x_1 > y_1 > z_1$, the result is immediate. If $ x_1 = y_1 > z_1$ (or $ x_1 > y_1 = z_1$), then $ x_1 > z_1$ and we get the result. If the three terms are equal, by hypothesis we know that $ x_2 \geq y_2 \geq z_2$ by hypothesis and we can conclude that the relation is transitive. 


\textit{Proof of the non-continuity of the function:}

Assume a function $u : \mathbb{R}^2_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ represents the lexicographic preferences.

Then, $ u(x + \dfrac{1}{n}, y-1) > u(x , y) > u(x - \dfrac{1}{n}, y+1) $

The sequences in $\mathbb{R}$  $(x + \dfrac{1}{n})_n$ and $(x - \dfrac{1}{n})_n$ are convergent and both have the same limit x. 

We notice that $ u(x , y-1)< u(x , y) < u(x , y+1) $.

We know that a function is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences. It is immediate that it is not the case here.\\

\textit{Proof of the non-existence of the function:}

We want to show that a function does not exist, i.e. the function is not well-defined. In words, a function is a way to associate the elements of two sets. In order to show that a function is not well-defined is to emphasize an incoherence between the function properties and the sets properties. Here we use an associate function $q$ to show that $u$ is not well-defined.

Assume a function  $u : \mathbb{R}^2_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ represents the lexicographic preferences.

For any $a \in [0,1]$, $ (a, 1) \succ (a, 0)$ since $ (a, 1) \succeq (a, 0)$ but $ (a, 0) \succ (a, 1)$ is not true. Thus, if such a function $ u$ existed, we would have $ u(a, 1) > u(a, 0)$ what implies that the interval $I_a = (u(a, 0), u(a, 1))$ is non-empty.

Assume a function $q$ from $[0, 1] $ into the set of the rational numbers $ \mathbb{Q} $ such that for any $b \in [0,1]$, $q(b)  \in  I_b = (u(b, 0), u(b, 1))$. Such a function exists since $ \mathbb{Q}$ is dense in  $\mathbb{R}$. 

By definition, we have that $ I_a \cap I_b = \emptyset$, so $q(a) \neq q(b) $. Then we get that $ q$ is a one-to-one (injective) function, and that: $$\forall a \neq b, \quad q(a) \neq q(b). $$

In words, there are as many $q(a) $ as $ a$. However, $\vert \mathbb{Q} \vert < \vert \mathbb{R} \vert $, what contradicts the fact that $q$ is a one-to-one function.\\
