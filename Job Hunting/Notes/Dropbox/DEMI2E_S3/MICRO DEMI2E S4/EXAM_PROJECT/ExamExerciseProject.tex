\section*{Exercise : Exchange and Production Economy }
It is advised to do the first part before the second part.\\

\subsection*{Part I {\small (4.5 points, difficulty **)}}
Assume an economy with two consumers $i = A, B$, and two goods $l = 1, 2$. The individual endowments of $A$ and $B$ are $\omega^A = \omega^B = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$. Good 2 is the numeraire good (i.e. $p_2 = 1$). We note $p_1 = p$. The preferences of the consumer are represented by the utility functions :
\begin{equation*}
u^A(x_1^A, x_2^A) = ln(x_1^A) + ln(x_2^A) \quad  \quad
u^B(x_1^B, x_2^B) = (x_1^B)^{\frac{1}{4}}(x_2^B)^{\frac{3}{4}} 
\end{equation*}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the Walrasian equilibrium (find $p = \frac{3}{5}$ and allocations $((\frac{2}{3},\frac{2}{5}) ; (\frac{1}{3},\frac{3}{5})$). (2.5 points)
\item Check if the Walrasian equilibrium is Pareto-optimal. Which computations should be made to check that the equilibrium is in the core ? (2 points)

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part II {\small (7 points, difficulty ** and ***)}}
We carry on working in the same framework with the same consumers (same preferences and endowments). A firm is created by the consumer B to produce good 2 using good 1 as input. The production function is $y_2 = \sqrt{y_1}$. We note $\pi$ the firm's profit. In the following questions, the firm maximises its profit independently of the consumer B's preferences. The profit is then added to the consumer B's budget.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Determine the demand for good 1 of the firm and the consumers. Prove the price $p$ is equal to $p =\frac{3+\sqrt{59}}{3}$. (2 points) 
\item The production function becomes $y_2 = y_1$. Determine the demand for good 1 of the firm and the consumers by distinguish 3 cases with respect to the value of $p$. (2.5 points)
\item The production function becomes $y_2 = \frac{y_1}{c}$ (with $c>0$). Determine the values of c such that the the firm is active at equilibrium (i.e. $y_1 > 0$) and the values of $c$ such that the firm is not active (Hint : Show that, for some values of $c$, there is
an excess demand of good 1 when the firm is active). Compare the equilibrium of question I.1 with the equilibrium with the non active firm. (2.5 points)

\end{enumerate}
